Analysis tool: Matlab This is the final group project of the course "Quantitative Models of Climate Systems." I synthesized ENSO index data and the Indonesian pulp industriesâ€™ financial records, creating a decision model providing recommendations for forest fire protecting investment to pulp companies in different climatic situations. Different risk attitude (i.e., risk neutral/averse) is also taken into consideration. This project received the highest grade in the class.
